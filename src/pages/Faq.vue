          <div><q-icon :name="stage_icon" color="grey" :size="stage_icon_size" class="stage_icon" />When you see a deal you want to text us quickly letting us know you are interested. We call investors back in the order we receive the messages. Deals will go quickly and the better the deal the quicker it will go. When we negotiate a good price it is important to get it secured quickly. When we call you; you must be in a position to reserve the deal by signing and sending us the sourcing fee.</div>

          <div>A qualified investor is an investor who is ready to move quickly when the right opportunity comes along. We will be setting up deals where we negotiate a below market value price with the vendor. This means it is important to be in a position to act quickly to take the deal which is why if you are serious about getting an investment property you need to be ready.</div>
